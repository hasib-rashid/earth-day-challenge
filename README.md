Hi there! üëã I am Hasib, the developer behind the Earth Day Challenge Glam up my Markup project aimed at raising awareness about the pressing issue of Global Warming. I take pride in using my skills to create websites that promote environmental consciousness, thanks to this challenge.

In the homepage, I included a rotating spinning earth that displays all the wildfires currently burning live around the world. This visual representation allows people to grasp the current state of our planet and understand the detrimental effects of global warming on our environment. By witnessing this, individuals can become more aware and take action to protect the earth from potential disasters in the future.

üåç You can view the demo website for my project
[Demo of the Project](https://earth-day-challenge.vercel.app)  

üëë The source code of the project is open source and available on Github

‚úÖ Upon discovering this challenge, I decided to participate and built the website using Vite and React.

‚òëÔ∏è Throughout the process, I gained valuable insights into Three.JS and React Globes, particularly in integrating them with the NASA API. By utilizing the NASA Wildfire API to plot points and track fires on the map, I had an enjoyable experience working on this project.

  

Thank you for your support! Please feel free to leave comments and suggestions for future improvements.
